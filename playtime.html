    <h1>Playtime Activities</h1>
    <p id="playtime">Piper loves to play tug of war. She has a tendency to get too excited and rip apart her toys piece by piece until there's nothing left but a scrap of material and stuffing... everywhere. Tug is a daytime game only now.
    Piper is also a fan of playing with her "Chuck It" ball outside in the baseball field. She will run and run and run until she can't anymore. If she is a good girl and picks up her toy and walks it home, she gets an ice cube as a reward. Mmmmm!<p>
